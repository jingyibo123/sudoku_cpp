# sudoku_solver_cpp
Sudoku solver in c++ inspired by Peter Novig's algorithm (http://norvig.com/sudoku.html)

The coding style is more C-like with a lot of arrays and loops.  There's still a lot of room for performance optimization. 

Performance: 96 ms (C++) ~180 ms(Java) used to solve the 95 puzzle in puzzle.txt (i5-4340M @2.9GHz).
